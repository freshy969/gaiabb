# gaiabb

GaiaBB is a full featured forum, and is the ultimate descendant of XMB. 

This software runs a very large car forum, with 20000 members and more than a million posts, so can scale to what 
you need. 

It is in the process of being updated to PHP 7 compatible, but should run fine on PHP 5.4.0 and later.
